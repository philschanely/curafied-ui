Do you understand that you have created the person you have become and created the quality of life you have.\n\nTake a good look at what you have created. You, and only you, are responsible for your present level of success in life.\n\nRight now, reflect on ways to make a positive difference in the quality of your life.  First, choose the area of life you want to focus. It can be your relationship, your career, your health; your finances just to mention a few. The most important thing to remember is to focus on just one area to start.\n\nAs you conquer the first obstacle, then go to the next. Keep moving forward until your goals are reached.\n\nKnow your purpose. Increase your awareness of your inner wisdom by regularly reflecting in silence. Breathe deeply to quiet your distracted mind. Identify your life purpose and stop wandering through life with little or no direction. \n\nYou must stop and smell the roses. Try this experiment and take note of reactions of different types of people.\n\n1.\tGo to your local park\n\n2.\tFind a bed of flowers or some magnificent location.\n\n3.\tCarefully watch people passing this location.\n\nSome will stop and enjoy the flowers. They will take time to smell and touch and enjoy them. Some will walk by and offer no more than a quick glance. Others will pass by and never see them at all. If you stop them and ask, they will reply “what flowers?”\n\nMeditation is like stopping and smelling the flowers. It is an intensely personal and spiritual experience. There are many forms of meditation however they all use concentration techniques that helps us become aware of all of our inner thoughts.\n\nMeditation is the key to finding your secret force that can overcome these obstacles and change your way of life. \n\nYou must first take action to face your current fears, honor your strengths and live from the inside out.\n\nLive your life on purpose, not by accident. \n\nThe Past – It’s gone and should be no more than a fading memory.\n\nThe Future – It has not happened yet. Things you do today are likely to impact your future.\n\nDon’t compare your present situation to anything else. Accept it for what it is and make the best of it or decide to Take Action now if it is not the present that you are happy with.\n\nThe time is here to decide that there is no such thing as failure. It is time to take the opportunity to learn from the experience and move forward. Learn from your mistakes and grow wiser and stronger and you will grow to accomplish more.\n\nAre you stuck in a rut and unsure how to make changes in your life?\n\nDo you need some support in helping motivate you to move forward in achieving the life you deserve?\n\nIt’s your life. Don’t complain if you are not willing to Take Action.\n\nWith clear goals and constructive support, you will be surprised how fast progress will be made.",
